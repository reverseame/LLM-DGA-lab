Malicious AGDs are typically grouped into families, where each family is created using a specific Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) and a seed value. This algorithm-seed combination acts as a "recipe" that produces similar-looking domains within the same family.

There are some of known malicious AGD families that you should know to classify. The format is the name of the family followed by the character ":" and then a list of malicious AGDs separated by the character "," and limited by the character ";". The families are the following:
